So, I hiked from the valley station to the cable car’s mountain station: 1600 meters of elevation gain and 20 km, and apart from my basic fitness, I was completely unprepared. It worked out well, so the next challenge: Stoneman Dolomiti Hike with 56 km and 3300 meters of elevation gain. 😳</p> <h2 id="elevation-training">Elevation Training</h2> <p>Of course, this time I can’t do it without proper preparation—that would be reckless and foolish. That’s why I started getting in shape for it some time ago: I regularly go to the gym and use the stair master, basically an endless staircase, and climb my steps. And in fact, I can now consistently maintain 60 steps per minute for over an hour, even with a backpack — that’s 720 meters of elevation gain per hour.</p> <p>Here is an image of the stair master 😅 <img src="/assets/img/2025-05-15-stoneman-training/thumbnail.png" width="30%"/></p> <h2 id="distance-training">Distance Training</h2> <p>The second part of my training is a bit more time-consuming. The elevation gain isn’t the only “problem”; there’s also the distance of 56 km. To simulate that in the gym, I would have to stand on a treadmill for about 11 hours, and somehow that just feels silly. So instead, I head out into nature and just go.</p> <h3 id="07052025">07.05.2025</h3> <p>In March, I already completed a somewhat longer tour (27.4 km and 720 meters of elevation gain) quite well.</p> <div class="cookie-wrapper komoot-wrapper" ccb-cookie-type="ccb_komoot" komoot="2085579060" token="aY57e5cx9ipPyoukfcCi166EOZCAe7jaB1vSD53GAZMuI22BZY"></div> <h3 id="11052025">11.05.2025</h3> <p>Last weekend, I took the next step (33.4 km and 940 meters of elevation gain).</p> <div class="cookie-wrapper komoot-wrapper" ccb-cookie-type="ccb_komoot" komoot="2236047118" token="aYKy3VtmA2QtW6FtkR8kQDje5HmZG7v1x0wTNGgqjREDQ6XOK5"></div> <p>The next tour is currently being planned with 49.7 km and 1200 meters of elevation gain. 😂</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;birthdate&quot; =&gt; &quot;15.12.1994&quot;}</name></author><category term="private"/><category term="holiday"/><category term="hiking"/><category term="adventure"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last year on tenerife, I set myself a little challenge: I wanted to hike up Teide — on foot, of course.
