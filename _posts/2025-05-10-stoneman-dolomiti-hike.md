Last year on [tenerife]({% post_url 2025-02-05-tenerife %}), I set myself a little challenge: I wanted to hike up
Teide â€” on foot, of course. So, I hiked from the valley station to the cable carâ€™s mountain station: 1600 meters of
elevation gain and 20 km, and apart from my basic fitness, I was completely unprepared. It worked out well, so the next
challenge: Stoneman Dolomiti Hike with 56 km and 3300 meters of elevation gain. ðŸ˜³
