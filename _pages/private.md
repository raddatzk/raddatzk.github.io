I am a member of the [Affenbande](https://www.instagram.com/affenbande_climbing/), a diverse group of friends with a
wide range of interests and activities. Together, we constantly discover new things and experience exciting adventures.
In my free time, I am particularly drawn to the outdoors: I love climbing, bouldering, and hiking. Camping under the
open sky, immersing myself in nature, and exploring vast landscapes always captivate me anew. Even though I enjoy being
on my own—like during my vacation in [Tenerife]({% post_url 2025-02-05-tenerife %}) or the planned adventure on the
[Stoneman Dolomiti Hike]({% post_url 2025-05-15-stoneman-training %}) — community always remains my main focus.

I like to capture my adventures and impressions on film, transforming them into documentary memories. It brings me great
joy not only to experience moments but also to visually document them and share them with others.

Besides my outdoor activities, I am passionate about discovering new topics and content—whether technical, cultural, or
simply out of sheer curiosity. I love expanding my horizons and diving into unknown worlds.

My greatest strength is certainly my calmness. Even in challenging or stressful situations, I remain composed, which
helps me and those around me to maintain an overview and consciously experience things. This calmness allows me to make
clear decisions even in turbulent moments and not lose focus.
