My professional career began as a software developer with a focus on Java for web services. Early on, I developed a
particular interest in software quality, which motivated me to delve deeper into this field.

This interest later expanded to include software and project security, which now form the core of my professional
activities. For me, the combination of quality and security is essential to develop robust and reliable applications.

I am both a dependable team player and capable of working independently and goal-oriented. My greatest strength is my
calmness: even in complex and stressful situations, I maintain a clear perspective and make thoughtful decisions. This
enables me to stay focused and work in a structured manner, even in demanding projects.

Additionally, I am characterized by my enthusiasm, which drives me to continuously discover new technologies and
methods, constantly evolving myself. This pursuit of progress motivates me to find innovative solutions and consistently
broaden my horizons.
