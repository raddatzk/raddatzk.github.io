If, for some reason, you wonder what equipment I use for my hobbies you can check here :)

I know, this page is very basic at this point, but I promise I will write more in the future.

Some links forward to amazon and are affiliated with my partner-id. You will not have any downside to just use my link -
this will give me a small "bonus" - but if you feel unconfident with such links, you can copy the link, paste into your
browser and remove everything after the "?". This will remove any tracking information
